# JSongBookIndexMaker
Java Utility for creating Indexes of [LaTeX Songbook Style](https://ctan.org/pkg/songbook).
It's mainly targeted for Windows but since Java is multiplataform you can use it on many other operating systems.

I used it on Windows while creating a [Worship songbook in spanish](https://github.com/javatlacati/Estribillero-Cristiano).
